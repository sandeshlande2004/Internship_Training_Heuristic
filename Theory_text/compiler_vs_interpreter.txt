Q. WHY COMPILER IS FASTER THAN INTERPRETER?

    A: Interpreter is slower than compiler, because the interpreter has to interpret the code line by line,
    whereas the compiler compiles the entire code into at once. This makes the compiler faster than the interpreter.

Q. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMPILER AND AN INTERPRETER?

    A: A compiler translates the entire code into machine code at once, whereas an interpreter interprets the code line by line.

                                           ** Key Differences **

Feature	                    Compiler	                                          Interpreter

Translation	       Translates the entire program at once.	               Translates and executes code line by line.

Speed	           Faster execution.	                                   Slower execution.

Error Detection	   Reports errors after the entire program is compiled.	   Reports errors immediately when encountered.

Examples	       C, C++, Go.	                                           Python, JavaScript, Ruby.
